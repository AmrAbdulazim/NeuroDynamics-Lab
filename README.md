# NeuroDynamics-Lab: From Single-Neuron Stochasticity to Neural Coding

## Abstract
This project focuses on the computational modeling of neuronal behavior using the **Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF)** framework. While traditional deterministic models provide a baseline, biological systems are inherently noisy. Here, I implement a **stochastic LIF model** to investigate how internal and external noise (Neural Noise) affects information processing and firing patterns. 

The goal is to transition from a single-neuron perspective to understanding how populations of neurons encode signals in the presence of biological variability.
